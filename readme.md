## Vuejs Playground

This is a Vuejs playground with samples that I keep adding to

When I want to test or research something I do it here

## Installation

Do the obvious things for a Laravel app, ie. create an .env, set the key etc.

* Pull in elixir, vue and vue-resource

        npm install

* For the browserify samples you can run the following

        gulp watch
